In the dotprod_serial.c program we can see that a struct is created with two pointers to ‘a’ and ‘b’, which are the vectors to be multiplied.

In the main function we allocate space for ‘a’ and ‘b’, then assign values to those vectors by looping thru them.
Later on, the vectors are assigned to the structure and the dot product function is called.

In the dotprod() function we assign the values to local variables and then the dot product is calculated by multiplying each corresponding index of the two vectors.

The control returns to the main routine and the dot product is printed.
